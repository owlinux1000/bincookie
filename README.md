# iOSCookieReader

## What's this

A simple tool to parse `Cookies.binarycookies` in iOS.

## Motivation

A parsing tool for binarycookies has already published such as [BinaryCookieReader](https://github.com/as0ler/BinaryCookieReader). However, this tools is implemented by Python2. So, I want to replace it.

## Other tools

- [burnt-cookie](https://github.com/horrorho/burnt-cookie)
  - The advantage of this tool is converting to a cookie file which is able to use with `curl`. burnt-cookie is implemented by Rust.
